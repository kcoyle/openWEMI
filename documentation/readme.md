# Documentation for openWEMI/CWO

* SWIBLightning.pdf - this is a lightning presentation I did at SWIB 2019 that led to a meeting later in the day where a number of folks showed up to discuss the concept of a generalized WEMI. It gives examples of existing uses (such as [FaBiO](http://purl.org/spar/fabio/), [Akoma-Ntoso](https://github.com/oasisopen/legaldocml-akomantoso/), and the [Music Ontology](http://musicontology.com/specification/), among others). There are some diagrams readers might find useful.
