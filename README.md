# openWEMI

This is work to create a non-constrained version of FRBR's Work, Expression, Manifestation, Item. In particular it removes any disjoint rules between the WEMI entities. It is based on the [FRBR Core](http://purl.org/vocab/frbr/core) created by Ian Davis and Richard Newman, with contributions by Bruce D'Arcus. 

It does not include the FRBR Group2 or Group3 entities (responsible bodies and subjects).
